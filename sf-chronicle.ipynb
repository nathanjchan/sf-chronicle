       " 'title': '‘The Hidden World’ brings a touching finish to the ‘How to Train Your Dragon’ series',\n",
       " 'text': 'The third installment in the animated “How to Train Your Dragon” series is a lovely movie that takes real chances. It moves the story forward considerably, so that it would be hard for the filmmakers to go back on the idea of this being the last of a trilogy. And it contains two sequences that are practically avant-garde in their freedom and audacity. The title is “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,” and the hidden world, in this case, is a utopia for dragons that exists at the end of the Earth. It’s a place of legend and is believed to be myth, but if it exists, it would solve the big problem troubling every nice person in the movie: In a hostile world, it’s very hard to keep dragons safe. The setting is a fantasy Viking land that never existed, in which people and dragons cohabit the Earth. Over two previous installments, the young Viking leader, Hiccup (the voice of Jay Baruchel), transformed his community’s feeling about dragons. Everybody likes them now. People fly around on them, and everyone is happy, except for one unsettling fact: The outside world still hates dragons and wants to hunt them. Indeed, Hiccup’s establishing his land as a dragon safe haven may actually imperil them all the more. Now they’re all in one place for their enemies to attack. In another animated movie — not just a bad one, but a mediocre one — this setup would be the pretext for a series of battles, in which good would finally triumph over evil in the five minutes before the finish. “Dragon 3” has what could be called a battle, too, but it’s more like a small-scale encounter, and the rest of the movie is devoted to showing two things: the devising and implementation of a permanent survival strategy. And the aspects of life that make survival worth the trouble. This brings us to the movie’s defining sequences, which are unusual in their strategy and strong in their impact. The titular dragon, Hiccup’s own dragon, Toothless, is a special dragon known as a Night Fury and thought to be the only one in existence. Well — good news for everyone — there’s another Night Fury, a girl Night Fury, and …\\xa0 well, you know where this is going, right? Toothless and the wild, undomesticated female Fury meet, and they start checking each other out. What follows is more than obligatory sniffing around. It’s a long scene of two wild animals trying to communicate, without access to words. Each takes chances. Each tries to build trust. There’s backing off, and there’s moving forward. There’s interest and resistance, and this goes on for minutes. It’s a beautifully choreographed achievement in conception alone, but this is animation and can’t merely be conceived. It must be executed, with delicacy and detail in the facial expressions, so that we can track every flicker of feeling, as though we were looking at Harriet Andersson in an Ingmar Bergman movie. This is sensitive, gorgeous work. And then it gets even better, because 15 minutes later, this sequence is surpassed by a mini-masterpiece, in which Toothless takes off into the sky looking for the female Fury. He finds her, and what follows is a kind of ecstatic expression of young existence, again wordless, as they fly just over the ocean, through a waterfall, and discover their dragon utopia. We see a bright place bursting with orange light, as the soundtrack soars with music straight out of a biblical epic scored by Miklos Rozsa. In “The Hidden World,” the struggle for good and evil is present, but only as a plot device. The movie’s main concern are the passages of life, which can be painful enough, but also can be glorious. The movie enacts, in fantasy form, the process by which children grow up, find love and leave their parents, and watching this, it’s easy to wonder if kids, who are the target audience for this film, will remember “Dragon 3” when they become adults, 10 or 15 years from now. By the way, if you’re wondering about the subliminal appeal of the dragons — why these animated creatures look adorable on screen and not menacing at all — here’s why: Their movements, behaviors and expressions are based on cats. Once you know, it’s the most obvious thing in the world. NHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World: Animation. Starring the voices of Jay Baruchel and America Ferrera. Directed by Dean DeBlois.

       " 'title': \"Feinstein's tense exchange with Green New Deal kids: 'I know what I'm doing'\",\n",
       " 'text': \"Typically when young people visit their senator’s office, they go home with a bunch of grip-and-grin photos showing them shaking hands with the lawmaker. But when an environmental activist group brought several children to Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s San Francisco office Friday to lobby her to back the Green New Deal, what they got was more of a finger-wagging than a handshake. The group, the Sunrise Movement, posted a video that promptly went viral of Bay Area kids ages 7 to 16 quarreling with the 85-year-old Democrat, who was just elected to her fifth full term. The Sunrise Movement wants lawmakers to pass the Green New Deal, a nonbinding proposal backed by first-term Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., that calls for the U.S. to run on 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years. This is how @SenFeinstein reacted to children asking her to support the #GreenNewDeal resolution -- with smugness + disrespect.This is a fight for our generation's survival. Her reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress. pic.twitter.com/0zAkaxruMI The proposal is popular with left-leaning Democrats. But there are plenty of other ideas attached to the resolution, including a guarantee of universal health coverage and government support for making college affordable for all. It contains no cost estimates or funding sources. Republicans have denounced it as socialism on the march and centrists, including Feinstein, are dubious. In their get-together Friday, Feinstein told the group of young people that the proposal had no hope of passing the Republican-controlled Senate, and explained that she had a version that might stand a chance. In the two-minute, 19-second video posted by Sunrise, an edited version of a roughly 14-minute exchange, one of the children tells Feinstein, “Some scientists have said that we have 12 years to turn this (the effects of climate change) around.” “Well, it’s not going to get turned around in 10 years,” Feinstein replies. One of the children says, “The government is supposed to be for the people, by the people.” “You know what’s interesting about this group?” Feinstein replies. “I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I’m doing. You come in here and it has to be my way or the highway. I don’t respond to that. I’ve gotten elected. I just ran. I was elected by almost a million-vote plurality. I know what I’m doing. So maybe people should listen a little bit.” “I hear what you saying, but we’re the people who voted for you,” a teenager says to Feinstein. “You’re supposed to listen to us.” “How old are you?” Feinstein asks. “I’m 16, I can’t vote,” the girl replies. “Well, you didn’t vote for me,” Feinstein says. An adult with the group tells the senator that any climate change proposal that doesn’t “take bold, transformative action is not going to be what we need.” “Well, you know better than I do,” Feinstein says. “So I think one day you should run for the Senate. And then you do it your way. “But in the meantime,” Feinstein adds, “I just won a big election.” The edited Sunrise version ends shortly thereafter. The full video shows that the atmosphere became less tense after the meeting broke up and Feinstein walked with some of the youths in her office, explaining her position. At one point one of the teenagers asked about an internship, and Feinstein appeared to tell her staff to arrange it. Sunrise spokesman Stephen O’Hanlon said Feinstein’s opposition “shows why we need fundamental change in the Democratic Party. Leaders like Feinstein are out of touch with the center of energy in the party, which is with the grassroots movement for a Green New Deal.” Feinstein issued a statement saying, “I want the children to know they were heard loud and clear. I have been and remain committed to doing everything I can to enact real, meaningful climate change legislation. “We had a spirited discussion and I presented the group with my draft resolution that provides specific responses to the climate change crisis, which I plan to introduce soon.” The youths may not have gone home with a photo of Feinstein, but they got a bigger souvenir in the digital age: The video of their encounter was viewed 1.4 million times within its first few hours online.

       " 'title': 'SF Public Defender Jeff Adachi dies',\n",
       " 'text': 'San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi, a renowned advocate for the accused and an outspoken watchdog on police misconduct, has died. He was 59. Mayor London Breed confirmed Friday night that Adachi had died, saying that San Francisco had “lost a dedicated public servant.” He was the only elected public defender in California. The exact circumstances and cause of Adachi’s death were not immediately known, but sources said he died of a heart attack. “As one of the few elected public defenders in our country, Jeff always stood up for those who didn’t have a voice, have been ignored and overlooked, and who needed a real champion,” Breed said in a statement. “He was committed not only to the fight for justice in the courtroom, but he was also a relentless advocate for criminal justice reform. “Jeff led the way on progressive policy reforms, including reducing recidivism, ending cash bail, and standing up for undocumented and unrepresented children.” Adachi’s colleagues were in shock and mourning the city’s loss. Deputy Public Defender Eric Quandt called his boss “a true visionary for equal rights and criminal justice.” “I’ve never seen a defense lawyer more tenacious or courageous,” Quandt said. “He made the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office one of the premier law firms in the nation. I’m so proud to have had the opportunity to work under his guidance. I’m devastated. I’m sure I’m speaking for many of my colleagues.” He is remembered as being a firebrand — an intense and tenacious man who delved deeply into the subjects he cared about, regardless of what anyone else thought. From a young age, he enjoyed solitary pursuits, like writing and reading, he told The Chronicle in 2010. He went on to study business at Sacramento City College before transferring to UC Berkeley. He graduated from UC Hastings College of the Law in 1985. A year later, the Public Defender’s Office hired him. Adachi had been sworn in for another term as a public defender in January after running unopposed. Unlike other city department heads who focus on management, Adachi would regularly step up and defend clients himself. In December, he won an acquittal for Carlos Argueta, an immigrant rights attorney who faced a murder charge. “I am deeply saddened by the unexpected news today,” said city District Attorney George Gascón. “Jeff was a passionate and relentless advocate who always fought hard for what he believed in. He represented the underserved and gave his career to public service.” State Sen. Scott Wiener remembered Adachi as a man of his word, one who “fought like a dog for what he believed in for his clients.” “I always knew that everything he said or did came from the heart,” Wiener said. “He was someone who, it didn’t matter to him what people thought about him or if people were mad at him. He was there to fight for the most marginalized people in society.” Adachi’s passion for social justice extended outside of City Hall, too, to documentary filmmaking. His films, “You Don’t Know Jack: The Jack Soo Story” (2009) and “The Slanted Screen” (2006), examined the challenges Asian American actors faced in Hollywood. “Defender” (2017), co-directed by Jim Choi, used a case Adachi defended to examine racial inequities in the criminal justice system. Each of the films were shown in film festivals. Former Supervisor Bevan Dufty, who now serves on the BART Board of Directors, knew Adachi for more than 20 years and remembered him as a ferocious advocate. He was well known at City Hall for fighting for more money for his budget. “He really tried to see the big picture in promoting services and approaches to reducing recidivism,” Dufty said. “I really felt like (Adachi) had a vision that was needed to reduce the involvement of poor people in the justice system. I didn’t always agree with him, but I always appreciated that he made this job so much bigger than what the charter called for. He had a great sense of humor.” Every year, Adachi’s office wore T-shirts in San Francisco’s Gay Pride Parade that read, ‘Getting People Off Since 1921.” Adachi also published an annual calendar featuring pictures of his lawyers. “He wasn’t somebody who tried to stay under the radar,” Dufty said. “He was proud of the work he did, he cared deeply about his clients, and he was an important part of the reform movement in our justice system.” Supervisor Hillary Ronen said she was devastated by the loss. “He made so many of us feel safe,” she said. “For people of color, they knew that no matter how bad things got, they had the fiercest advocate who would always stand by their side. He was one of a kind.” Ronen’s husband, Francisco Ugarte,  worked in Adachi’s office representing undocumented immigrants. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo, whose district includes part of San Francisco, called Adachi “the real deal ... a righteous public servant who believed passionately in the Constitution, due process and the rights of the accused to be ably represented by counsel. He did not shrink from public debate or tough political decisions.” “The last time I saw him he was at a political event decked out in a beautiful jacket for Halloween, and it was 8 a.m. in the morning,” she said in a statement. “My prayers go out to his family at this painful and numbing time. The community of San Francisco will envelop you and give you strength. God bless you.” Adachi took great pride in being an elected public defender, saying it gave him an independence he wouldn’t have if he was appointed by someone. “Letting voters elect a public defender has dramatic, real-world advantages,” he wrote in a March 2018 letter to the Los Angeles Times to take issue with an editorial in that paper saying electing public defenders was not necessary. “Because I’m elected, I’ve been able to publicly advocate for proper funding — even refusing cases — without fear of being fired by the mayor or board of supervisors,” he wrote. “We’ve been able to hire social workers for families and immigration specialists to fight deportation and re-entry staff to bring down recidivism. That’s something that benefits all San Franciscans, not just those charged with crimes.” Chronicle staff writer G. Allen Johnson contributed to this report.

       " 'title': \"California's stem cell bet: Lofty promises, limited results\",\n",
       " 'text': 'It was an extraordinary political proposal: Approve a $3 billion bond measure to fund the cutting-edge science of stem cell therapy, and soon some of the world’s cruelest diseases and most disabling injuries could be eradicated. The 2004 measure was Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Initiative. The campaign to pass it was led by a Palo Alto real estate developer whose son suffered from an incurable illness that he believed stem cells, the keystones of human biology, could heal. Other supporters\\xa0included preeminent scientists, Hollywood celebrities, business leaders and elite investors. The need was urgent, they said. Federal restrictions had recently been imposed on funding research involving human embryonic stem cells, then the most auspicious\\xa0field of study. Among the campaign’s promises: Nearly half of all families in California could benefit from stem cell treatments Prop. 71 would help create. One study it commissioned found that new, life-changing therapies could emerge in just a few years. And Prop. 71 would pay off financially,\\xa0the campaign claimed, creating thousands of jobs and potentially returning the state\\'s investment more than seven times over. \"How many chances in a lifetime do you have to impact human suffering in a really fundamental way, including possibly even in your own family?\" Robert Klein, the campaign leader, would say shortly after the vote. In November 2004, Prop. 71\\xa0passed with nearly 60 percent approval. It created the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM, an agency tasked with administering the $3 billion and making the campaign’s lofty visions a reality. Fourteen\\xa0years later, the money voters approved is nearly gone, and supporters of CIRM and the research it funds are\\xa0preparing to ask\\xa0the public for another $5 billion in 2020. This time, taxpayers will want to know: Has California’s initial bet on stem cell science paid off? Over the past several months, The Chronicle conducted an extensive analysis of CIRM’s spending, reviewing the nearly 1,000 grants the agency has made, tracking how the money has been spent, and gauging whether the promises have been realized. It’s not a question that can be answered simply.\\xa0Science often can’t be measured in quantifiable outcomes. Failures aren’t just common, they’re necessary — it’s impossible to expect every dollar invested in research to lead down a traceable path toward success. CIRM can take credit for some notable progress. It has helped make California a global leader in the field that’s come to be known as regenerative medicine.\\xa0Anywhere\\xa0significant stem cell research is taking place in the state, it almost surely has received support from CIRM. At UCLA, doctors are using stem cells to cure a rare immune deficiency disease\\xa0that kills children. At Stanford, early studies show that stem cells deposited deep into the brain could restore movement and speech to people devastated by stroke. At UCSF, a team is beginning human trials for a fatal genetic blood disease\\xa0that involves transplanting stem cells into a fetus still in the uterus. But as thrilling as such\\xa0advances are, they fall far short of what Prop. 71’s promoters promised. Not a single federally approved therapy has resulted\\xa0from CIRM-funded science. The predicted financial windfall has not materialized. The bulk of CIRM grants have gone to basic research, training programs and building new laboratories, not to clinical trials testing the kinds of potential cures\\xa0and therapies the billions of dollars\\xa0were supposed to deliver. Over that same time, many people\\xa0suffering from incurable diseases\\xa0have become impatient waiting for scientists to produce the miracle treatments the Prop. 71 campaign said were within reach. Instead, a thriving, for-profit industry of clinics\\xa0offering dubious stem cell therapies based on half-baked science has sprung up, defying attempts at government regulation and requests from scientists to proceed cautiously. Now, as CIRM supporters prepare to approach voters again, some say its achievements shouldn’t be measured only against the claims made by the campaign that created it. “What was promised was not deliverable,” said longtime CIRM board member\\xa0Jeff Sheehy, a former San Francisco supervisor.\\xa0“However, I would distinguish the promises from the impact and value. We have developed a regenerative medicine juggernaut.” Klein, though, is unapologetic about the campaign he led. Indeed,\\xa0as he lines up advocates and testimonials for the coming campaign, his message is familiar: Fund this research and we will save lives. Slow it down and the consequences will be grave. “Do you want your son to die? Are you going to wait?” Klein asked recently. “Is that the price you are prepared to pay?” In his airy, sunlit lab\\xa0at San Francisco’s Gladstone Institutes, cardiologist Deepak Srivastava has used skin cells to produce heart cells. As they pulse in a petri dish, their steady, calming beat feels familiar, even viewed through the lens of a microscope. “We got this far purely because of CIRM,” said Srivastava, the center’s director. The dream of exploiting the human body\\'s remarkable ability to heal itself — to grow skin and bone, to replace muscle lost to wasting or disease, to undo systemic damage caused by infection — has long captivated medical scientists. In the late 1800s, they began to suspect that specific cells in the body\\xa0were responsible for this repair and regeneration work. A century later, in 1981, UCSF scientist Gail Martin gave the most powerful of these cells a name: embryonic stem cells. It wasn’t until 1998 that the first human embryonic stem cells were isolated and replicated in a lab. These cells are uniquely potent, responsible for building every part of a human body. As an embryo matures, it rapidly replicates, transforming into bone cells and muscle cells, brain cells and heart cells. Some doctors believed if they could harness stem cells, they could use them to treat all but the most disastrous threats to the body, perhaps even reverse the natural effects of aging. The process of isolating them, though, involved destroying days-old embryos. Religious and antiabortion groups decried\\xa0the science\\xa0as unethical.\\xa0In 2001, President George W. Bush instituted far-reaching limitations on federal grants for embryonic stem cell research. In California, advocates for regenerative medicine sought a way around the funding restrictions. Their solution: Prop. 71, which would generate $3 billion in general obligation bonds, the type more often used for infrastructure projects like highways or dams. Including principal and interest, the total cost to taxpayers would be roughly $6 billion. State-funded scientific research on that scale had never been attempted and, despite the campaign’s pitch,\\xa0there was no guaranteed payoff. The state Legislative Analyst\\'s Office offered a cautious assessment: The potential financial\\xa0benefits were unknown. Klein, then a major Silicon Valley developer, helped conceive, bankroll and write Prop. 71. For him, the effort\\xa0was personal. His son, Jordan, had recently been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, and Klein had become a ferocious advocate for people with brutal conditions and little hope. More than 20 Nobel Prize laureates backed the proposal. So did Hollywood celebrities such as Michael J. Fox and Brad Pitt. Million-dollar donations came from the founders of eBay and the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team. In another, “Superman” actor Christopher Reeve, paralyzed from the neck down after a horseback riding accident, said “stem cells have already cured paralysis of animals” and called them the “future of medicine.” Dependent on a ventilator attached to his trachea, he struggled to breathe and to speak in the ad. He died before the spot aired. On Nov. 2, 2004, Prop. 71 passed\\xa0by 59 percent to 41 percent. It would take years, though, for the unprecedented experiment voters had approved to fully launch. Almost immediately, critics filed lawsuits. CIRM, the new stem cell institute, lacked public accountability, they said. While technically it was a state agency, the measure gave the Legislature little direct oversight of it. The legal challenges eventually were dismissed, but they slowed funding for nearly two years. Meanwhile, the confident claims of the campaign were being tempered with more modest expectations. A year after moving into its San Francisco headquarters, CIRM would unveil a 10-year plan\\xa0dramatically scaling back the pledges made by Prop. 71. The field of embryonic stem cell research was still young, the report warned. The road to marketing new therapies would be long and expensive. Most research never reaches human clinical trials, it explained, and most of those trials fail. Potential treatments for just a handful of diseases might be tested, and it was doubtful that a single approved therapy would be developed from the state’s investment. “The whole tenor of the campaign, what was said on television ads that flooded the state and by Bob Klein and his lobbying group, was that if California would fund this work, there would be cures,” said Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society in Berkeley. “People that were saying that must have known you can’t schedule medical breakthroughs. Those hopes were just that, hopes, and completely speculative.” But as CIRM ramped up, The Chronicle’s review shows, it began doling out grants at a furious pace, averaging\\xa0more than\\xa0$7\\xa0million a week in 2008,\\xa0its\\xa0first year\\xa0of full-fledged operation.\\xa0To date,\\xa0CIRM has spent or committed more than 90 percent of its $3 billion allowance. The grants can be broadly divided into four categories: basic science and training; infrastructure; translational and preclinical, which is the work that goes toward moving laboratory science into human studies; and clinical trials. The Chronicle reviewed CIRM grants through May 2018, tracking who received money and how it was spent. Bay Area institutions have been especially well-funded, with more than one-fifth of the bond money funneled to Stanford, UCSF, UC Berkeley and the Gladstone Institutes. Stanford, the biggest beneficiary, has received\\xa0$360\\xa0million\\xa0in grants. CIRM’s funding of Stanford, a private institution supported by a hefty endowment, has at times been sharply criticized. Nearly\\xa040 percent of the total bond money, more than $1.1 billion, has gone into training programs and basic research — work largely aimed at improving scientists’ understanding of stem cells and how they might be best used in medicine. CIRM’s focus, meanwhile, has expanded beyond embryonic stem cells. It has funded research involving adult stem cells, which exist in pockets throughout the body and are cheaper\\xa0and less controversial than embryonic stem cells. It’s also invested in\\xa0induced-pluripotent stem cells, first developed in 2006. Produced from other types of cells, they look and act like embryonic stem cells. CIRM-funded researchers have published more than 330 scholarly articles in four of the most respected stem cell\\xa0and academic\\xa0journals. Each represents a new discovery in the field and has\\xa0enabled the work California has funded to reach scientists around the world. CIRM’s investments in infrastructure have amounted to $482 million — 16 percent of the bond money. Most of that went toward building a dozen stem cell research centers. UCSF received a $35 million grant to\\xa0help raise a glass-and-metal structure on the hillside overlooking its Parnassus campus. The independent Buck Institute for Research on Aging received $20 million toward a sleek white building on its Novato grounds. Stanford University won the largest single grant: $43.6 million toward a four-story structure at the edge of its medical school campus built around a glass-walled atrium. About $388\\xa0million\\xa0has gone toward preclinical and translational research: studies that take science out of the lab and try to apply it to humans. This phase of research, seldom backed by the federal government, can be particularly challenging. A therapy that looks promising when tested on a cluster of cells in a laboratory-controlled environment\\xa0often fails when given to more complex organisms. The research has helped CIRM-backed scientists license 107 invention disclosures. Some of the studies have paved the way for clinical trials, while others have hit dead ends. “The whole reason I’m here in California is because of CIRM,” said Klassen, who had been working in Singapore and took a job\\xa0at Irvine shortly after Prop. 71 passed. “This consistent source of funding has been critical as we go from the bench to the bedside.” Still, critics and supporters alike say those who pushed Prop. 71 significantly oversold the short-term medical and financial prospects of stem cells. No federally approved treatments have been produced. And without marketable therapies, the public is still far from reaping the up to $91 billion in health care savings by 2040 the campaign predicted. CIRM has funded nearly 50 clinical trials, but just four have been completed, meaning scientists enrolled all the patients they said they would and finished compiling data.\\xa0One of those trials was an observational study that tested no new therapy. The others involved treatments that are still years, at best, from reaching the market. The state, once told to expect as much as $1.1 billion in royalties\\xa0from CIRM-backed discoveries within 35 years, so far has received just a tiny fraction of that amount: a single payment of $190,000\\xa0from the City of Hope medical research center in Los Angeles County. Other economic benefits, such as tax revenues\\xa0and new jobs, have been measured only a handful of times. The most recent study, which CIRM\\xa0commissioned using public funds and published in 2012, showed the state investment had helped create tens of thousands of jobs and generate hundreds of millions in tax revenue. The aim of the report, however, was to aggressively support the goals and initiatives of CIRM, according to the California Stem Cell Report, a blog that has diligently tracked the institute. CIRM and its 29-person governing board, meanwhile, have been a frequent target of attack. State lawmakers have introduced multiple bills aimed at making the institute more accountable to the public and at ensuring that all taxpayers, not just biotech companies and universities, would benefit from the public investments. Almost every effort has failed, in part due to the unusually restrictive language of Prop. 71: Any change in CIRM’s structure needs a voter initiative or a 70 percent vote in both houses of the Legislature and the governor’s approval. The proposition also specified the precise makeup of the agency’s governing board, placing representatives of many of the institutions that CIRM funds to oversee its grants.\\xa0Having such built-in conflicts of interest without the oversight expected of a public agency has undermined CIRM’s legitimacy, critics say. They have likened it to an insiders’ club that enriches its own members. “These guys got away with an incredible amount of personal enrichment,” said state Sen. John Moorlach, R-Irvine, a longtime critic of CIRM. “And all they gave us was debt.” CIRM leaders say they have strong protections to ensure that personal interests don’t influence funding decisions: Board members don’t discuss or vote on proposals they have a financial stake in, and an out-of-state review panel has a major say in which projects are funded. Multiple audits, however, have found the sheer volume of recusals troubling. Records obtained by The Chronicle showed that board members abstained from voting on grants roughly 1,770 times since 2006 due to reported\\xa0financial conflicts.\\xa0Tens of thousands of additional recusals were triggered by a CIRM policy that bars certain members from weighing in on any application. In some cases, nearly half of the board\\xa0was unable to vote on major and controversial proposals\\xa0due to conflicts of interest. One board member, UC Regent Sherry Lansing, a former film studio executive, has recused herself from more than 400 grant discussions because of a tangle of conflicts, most related to the universities she oversees. Lansing’s role is to advocate for cancer patients. A pivotal Institute of Medicine review in 2012 \\xa0found that such widespread conflicts had caused some to “question the integrity and independence” of CIRM, and it recommended sweeping reforms. Many of the suggestions were not enacted, although CIRM did make some significant\\xa0changes shortly after the report published. Klein, CIRM’s board chairman during its first seven years, has been a divisive figure. Despite his role at CIRM, he continued to run a patient advocacy group that regularly dismissed concerns about the agency and attacked many people, including legislators, who challenged it. A 2009 Little Hoover Commission report called him “a lightning rod for calls for more accountability.”\\xa0There were multiple demands for his resignation. “There’s a reason you have checks and balances, transparency and accountability when you use that much in public funds, and unfortunately none of that was in place,” said former state Sen. Deborah Ortiz, who strongly supported Prop. 71,\\xa0then became a CIRM critic. “You can\\'t go to the voters and say, ‘Let’s use $3 billion in state funds,’ then say, ‘We don’t want the terrible government to bother us.’ ” Even some of CIRM’s most ardent supporters — patients and patient advocates who stand to benefit most directly from stem cell therapies — have become critical. Their chief complaint: The science is taking too long, and they’re running out of time. At the Gladstone Institutes’ Mission Bay campus\\xa0last fall, CIRM held a public meeting to update patients about the research going on throughout California. CIRM representatives and scientists\\xa0told the story of a mother who had her vision partially restored after enrolling in Klassen’s trial at UC Irvine. They talked about an East Bay teenager, paralyzed the day before graduating high school, who regained some movement after receiving a stem cell transplant. The $3 billion bond, they said, had made these achievements possible. “What you will see over the next decade,” Srivastava of the Gladstone Institutes told the crowd, “are a series of breakthroughs for many diseases based on that investment.” Not everyone shared his enthusiasm. “I’ve met hundreds, thousands of people with spinal cord injuries,” Franklin Elieh, a quadriplegic man and patient advocate, said at the same meeting. “Millions are suffering needlessly and endlessly. Billions (of dollars) are being spent needlessly and endlessly. What can be done to really accelerate this?” Elieh, like many people living with incurable diseases or conditions, is disillusioned\\xa0with the dearth of clinical trials CIRM has backed. Clinical trials are the goal of laboratory medical science. They are the moment that a possible treatment, studied only in a test tube or a dish or an animal, finally is tested on a human subject. The first two trial\\xa0phases primarily test safety: Does this treatment, when given to a human being at an effective dose, cause intolerable side effects? Phase 3 trials are typically the first to tell scientists how well a therapy works in large groups of patients, if it works at all. They are often the last step before scientists — usually working with a for-profit company that has financed the increasingly expensive research — seek FDA approval. About 900 patients have been involved in the 49 clinical trials\\xa0CIRM has backed so far, The Chronicle’s review shows. Nearly a fifth of CIRM’s funds, about $530 million, has gone\\xa0to support the trials.\\xa0Most of those grants were awarded in the past three years, part of a deliberate effort by the agency to direct more money toward testing treatments. “Every single project we have is spectacular, and just a couple of years ago may have been considered science fiction,” CIRM President Maria Millan told a state legislative committee in August as she outlined many of the clinical trials the agency has funded. Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health, the primary federal funding agency for medical research, has far outpaced CIRM in supporting clinical trials in stem cell research. A 2017 analysis by STAT, a science and health news publication,\\xa0found that, dollar for dollar, the NIH funded 3 1/2 times as many clinical trials\\xa0as CIRM from 2006 to 2016. In 2009, President Barack Obama lifted most of the restrictions on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research, but for\\xa0both agencies, trials using those cells remain rare. “When we voted for Prop. 71 we wanted clinical trials, we didn’t want basic research,” said Judy Roberson, a longtime CIRM supporter who has lost five family members, including her husband, to Huntington’s disease. Roberson has 17 other relatives who are also at high risk of developing the hereditary neurological disorder, which slowly erodes a person’s ability to walk and talk. “Our loved ones are going to die. They’re sitting on time bombs,” she said. “You could do basic research for 100 years, but you’re never going to learn everything. So just get in there and try something.” But accelerating the push of basic science toward human trials is not without its critics. The International Society for Stem Cell Research — the largest body of scientists looking at policy and politics in regenerative medicine — has cautioned against that\\xa0approach.\\xa0Many scientists say that, in general, it’s too early to be experimenting on people, particularly with embryonic and induced-pluripotent stem cells, which may cause tumors. Gene therapy,\\xa0a field related to stem cells, underwent more than 30 years of grueling research and repeated setbacks before establishing its first commercial successes in 2017: two cancer treatments approved by the FDA. Embryonic stem cells were isolated for the first time just two decades ago. Induced-pluripotent stem cells were made only 12 years ago. Adult stem cells — the cells responsible for regular repair and upkeep — have been used in bone marrow transplants for more than 50 years, but their application beyond that started to be deeply studied only in the 1980s. “CIRM touts 50 or so projects moving toward the clinic, and many of them will likely fail,” Kriegstein said. “It might be more prudent to spend dollars solving basic research problems, where a relatively modest investment can have a huge impact.” Some suggest that CIRM’s recent aggressive support for\\xa0clinical trials is directly tied to its plan to return to voters for more funding. The fact that its work is supported by taxpayers increases the urgency to produce results, said Timothy Caulfield, a Canadian law professor at the University of Alberta who closely follows CIRM. “That creates a lot of pressure to frame the work in terms of near-future miracles, and that will almost always fail,” Caulfield said. “True medical breakthroughs with broad application are incredibly rare.” To patients desperate for cures, CIRM leaders say stay hopeful. The work may be taking longer than promised, but it will pay off in the end. And the state has too much invested now to give up. Such hope, though, isn’t easy to come by for those beginning to realize that any therapies to help them probably will arrive too late. “We see how slow progress is, and we know a lot of people are never going to be candidates for a treatment,” said Elieh, who is co-founder\\xa0of the Northern California Spinal Cord Injury Foundation, a nonprofit patient support group. Elieh, 54, was injured\\xa0in a diving accident in 1989, shattering his vertebrae and damaging his spinal cord so badly that he lost movement in his legs and upper body. In the years afterward, he enrolled in clinical trials and costly rehab programs, but none helped. During the Prop. 71 campaign, Elieh watched celebrities talk about the miraculous ability of stem cells to regenerate tissue. He saw videos of paralyzed rats that could walk again after receiving an injection of stem cells. Clinical trials, scientists said, were just years away. “Everyone you talked with thought, ‘Wow, we’re going to put $3 billion into this,’ ” Elieh said. “It was really creating hope. And, unfortunately for me, false hope.” Over the past decade CIRM has funded\\xa0two clinical trials\\xa0testing the same treatment for spinal cord injuries. The therapy, though, applies only to people newly injured, not the hundreds of thousands of men and women like Elieh who have been paralyzed for years. So far, the therapy has proven safe. A handful of patients in the second trial regained some movement, though it’s too soon to say whether stem cells are the reason. While CIRM supporters are keen to hold up that trial as an example of the stunning potential of stem cell therapies, Elieh and many of his peers are more cautious. “We’ve still barely taken the first step, and we have no idea when the second step will land,” Elieh said. \\xa0“We all had a lot of hope back then, and we’ve just kept hoping.” Seated on a stage before 50 people in a town-hall-style\\xa0meeting in Mill Valley, Art Torres had one word to describe the results of the CIRM-funded trial for spinal cord injuries: “Miraculous.” Torres, former state senator and long-time member of the CIRM board, was enthusiastic in a way that would have made the more cautious scientists running the trial cringe. But CIRM needs a home run. The looming end of its funding — and the need to ask voters for billions more — presents an existential moment. Since 2004, the political and scientific climate has changed significantly. Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research is no longer tied up, and many voters are savvier about the limitations of regenerative medicine. The scientists backed by CIRM, meanwhile, face unconventional competition from an unexpected source: a vibrant consumer-clinic industry that’s marketing unproven therapies to those tired of waiting for cures. Prop. 71’s most tangible achievements — cutting-edge academic buildings, discoveries in petri dishes, advances in lab rats, pioneering trials in human subjects — aren’t necessarily going to resonate with voters. What will are visible triumphs in real people. Those successes are what CIRM’s most ardent supporters are rallying around. On the cover of the agency’s 2017 annual report was a wide-eyed infant named Ronnie. He was cured of an immune deficiency disease called SCID, or “bubble-baby disease.” Children who have the condition typically live in isolation to protect them from fatal infections. CIRM has helped fund four trials, all at different institutions, testing stem cell therapies for SCID. Ronnie was treated at UCSF using a treatment developed at St. Jude Children\\'s Research Hospital in Tennessee. A therapy out of UCLA, which has been in clinical trials since 1993, could win FDA approval — a first for CIRM-backed research — in a year or two, say the scientists who developed the treatment. In all, 40 babies have been treated with the UCLA therapy. And there’s Rosie Barrero. In a video posted on CIRM’s website, Barrero sits in a sunny room at the agency’s headquarters, now in Oakland, Lake Merritt glittering behind her. She’s earnest as she talks about retinitis pigmentosa, the disease that has slowly blinded her. Barrero was treated in 2016 in Henry Klassen’s trial for patients with RP. Within months, she could pick out colors and shapes she hadn’t been able to see for years. She could tell her daughters apart. She has regained about “a pinhole” of sight, but that she’s had any improvement at all, she said, is amazing: It means that the therapy works. “We’re definitely hoping that this work continues to get funded,” Barrero said in an interview. “It’s incredibly important, to all of us.” If a new bond isn’t approved in 2020, said CIRM President Millan, it could devastate stem cell research in California. Private industry is still reluctant to back research\\xa0that has yet to produce a treatment, let alone show it can be profitable. And so, CIRM proponents are turning again to Robert Klein, who plans to lead the 2020 campaign for more research dollars. In Klein’s downtown Palo Alto office, a series of photos — colorful, fantastical close-ups of stem cells studied by CIRM scientists — hangs above his desk. Once they’d hung in CIRM’s offices. Today they reflect the deep connection he’s retained with the agency, despite not having an official role since stepping down as board chairman seven years ago amid a flurry of criticism. Late last year, Klein addressed the CIRM board at a meeting about the fate of the agency. According to polls he had paid for — the full results of which he declined to share — 70 percent of voters would support another stem cell funding proposition. No other options for future financing — not private fundraising, not legislative efforts — would work, he said. The loss seems to have cemented Klein’s resolve. “We couldn\\'t get there fast enough for Jordan,” Klein said. “We have to get there for everyone else.” Klein rejects the notion that expectations for CIRM were overhyped or voters misled in the 2004 campaign. If cures aren’t yet at hand, they’re surely years closer than they would be without CIRM, he said, and people already are benefitting from research paid for by Prop. 71. During an interview in his office, Klein played a brief video of a young man who is part of the spinal cord injury trial CIRM has helped fund. Made quadriplegic after a devastating car accident, the man is shown in the video lifting weights. “After the stem cell surgery, I’m able to live my life again,” the man says in a quiet, halting voice. “Thank you for giving me my life back.” Klein turned off the video, his eyes bright. “I wish all the voters could see this,” he said. Christopher Reeve, whom he considered a friend, “would have been absolutely ecstatic” to have seen such a video, he added. “In 2004 we had a vision of the future and data on animals,” Klein said. “In 2020, we will have patients who were paralyzed, patients who were blind, patients with cancer who will tell their story. The public will decide.”',\n",

    "I removed the words \"said\" and \"would\" because they are very common but don't add much to the trying to understand the content of the articles. What we can infer from \"said\" and \"would\" is that many articles are reporting on what people said, which we can totally expect from a news organization, and that many articles are making promises, or are reporting on people making promises. \"Would\" means that some action will happen in the future, so these articles must talk a lot of the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the three categories (business/tech, local, and politics), the top topics in the news recently are San Francisco, California, Trump, and Democrats. These topics are entirely predictable, since the company is located in San Francisco, California. Trump is always in the news, and local politicians will always talk about Trump. The politics section will undoubtedly mention him very often, as well as Democrats. Interestingly, the articles mention Democrats much more often than Republicans, but that is somewhat expected since California is mostly Democrats. But this also might hint at the political leaning of the news site. There doesn't seem to be any differentiating words for the business and tech section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other interesting and frequent words are \"newsom\" and \"cell.\" The first is in reference to Gavin Newsom, who is the new governor of California. It is no surprise that the articles mention him frequently. The articles talk about \"cell\" often, because there are a bunch of very long articles in the local section that talk about stem cells. However, let's go into how the sections differ."

    "The three sections will have different topics. The business and tech section predictably talks a lot about companies, work, accounts, and programs. What is interesting is the focus on YouTube, children, and video. This is likely because of a recent YouTube scandal where advertisers stopped advertising on YouTube because pedophiles were using YouTube to contact children.\n",
    "\n",
    "The local section focuses on other things: stem cells. On SF Chronicle recently, there are many long articles documenting stem cell research in California. There are other articles talking about patients and hospitals, a topic apparently big in the news recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in the politics section, we find the usual political terms: Democrats, Trump, Newsom, and Republicans. There are no surprises here. We also have words like people, work, president, elect, and money.\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like the majority of the articles came from the politics section, which is why political terms dominated the word counts when looking at the articles altogether. It's clear that the certain sections has an affect on the types of articles. Each section focuses on different topics and there doesn't seem to be much overlap, which is good for news readers who only want to read what they want to read."
